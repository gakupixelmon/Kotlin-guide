# Hello World!

Most programming textbooks begin by displaying **Hello World**.

Click **New Project**, choose any name you like, and keep the default location.  
A Git repository is used to track changes in your program, but it is not necessary for learning purposes.

For this tutorial, we will use IntelliJ as the build system unless otherwise specified.

For the JDK, select **Download JDK** from the dropdown menu on the right.  
Choose version **21**, and select **Amazon Corretto** as the vendor (any vendor is fine).  
You can keep the default installation location.

Uncheck **Add sample code**.

If a message such as “Free trial” appears, close it by clicking the **×** button near the top where it says “Trial Version”.

On the left side, find the **src** folder under “Project.”  
Right-click it and select:

New → Kotlin Class/File

Choose any name, select **File**, and press Enter.

## Problem 1

① `fun` is used to define a function.  
(For now, ignore return types and parameters.)

In programming, a function is a collection of instructions grouped together to perform a specific task.  
```
fun functionName(parameter1, parameter2, …) : ReturnType { }
```
② Every Kotlin program starts from a function named `main`.  
The `main` function does not require parameters or a return value, so we write it as: ```main()```  
③ The `print` function is used like this: ```print(something)```  
If you want to display `"abc"`, then *something* should be `"abc"`.

Change the `???` parts in the code below so that it prints:

Hello World!

Copy and paste the code below. After replacing `???`, click the green triangle next to `fun` to run the program.  
```
fun ???(){
???
}
```
